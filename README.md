## Practical 6
### The S.M.A.R.T goal of Prac 6
By the end of Practical 6, I looked for the teammate and set up the target of the group. We discussion for the work distribution. Here are the S.M.A.R.T criteria:

**Specific:** 
- Set up a private Slack channel for team communication.
- Establish a GitHub repository using the provided GitHub Classroom link, ensuring the repository name matches the Slack group team name/number.
- Copy the Trello template board for project planning.
- Integrate the GitHub repository and Trello board with the Slack group.

**Measurable:** 
- Each team member contribute to the project by making at least one GitHub commit.
- There should be evidence of the GitHub and Trello integration visible in the Slack group.

**Achievable:**
- All team members should be able to join the private Slack channel and create or join the GitHub repository.
- One team member each should be responsible for copying the Trello template board and integrating GitHub and Trello with the Slack group.

**Relevant:**
- The setup tasks align with the project's initial requirements, emphasizing effective communication, version control, project planning, and integration.

**Time-bound:**
- Completion of the setup tasks, including making the GitHub commit and finalizing the group agreement in the Trello board, should be accomplished within the specified project timeline.
