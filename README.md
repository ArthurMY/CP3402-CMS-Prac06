This is the weekly Journey for Practical 6

## Practical 6
### The S.M.A.R.T goal of Prac 6
By the end of Practical 6, I looked for the teammate and set up the target of the group. We discussed the work distribution. Here are the S.M.A.R.T criteria:

**Specific:** 
- Set up a private Slack channel for team communication.
- Establish a GitHub repository using the provided GitHub Classroom link, ensuring the repository name matches the Slack group team name/number.
- Copy the Trello template board for project planning.
- Integrate the GitHub repository and Trello board with the Slack group.

**Measurable:** 
- Each team member contributes to the project by making at least one GitHub commit.
- There should be evidence of the GitHub and Trello integration visible in the Slack group.

**Achievable:**
- All team members should be able to join the private Slack channel and create or join the GitHub repository.
- One team member each should be responsible for copying the Trello template board and integrating GitHub and Trello with the Slack group.

**Relevant:**
- The setup tasks align with the project's initial requirements, emphasizing effective communication, version control, project planning, and integration.

**Time-bound:**
- Completion of the setup tasks, including making the GitHub commit and finalizing the group agreement in the Trello board, should be accomplished within the specified project timeline. 


### Learning Journey for Practical 6
The main task for practical 6 is to set up with the team. After setting up the team, we used Slack, Trello, and GitHub to connect all the groupmate and assign the teamwork.

I watch some videos to understand the purpose of Trello and Slack.

After I learned about it, I joined the Trello board and the Slack board that was created by groupmate.

### Estimated hours
For Pracital 6, I spent a total of 3 hours on the setup and work distribution with groupmates.
We had a good and efficient communication, it helped us save time on discussion. 

### Learning Insights
I fought out that communication is extremely important for a group project. Also, the communication should be kept simple and easy to understand. Since we did do that and it helps our group save time on work distribution. 
Any option is better to straight away to discuss with teammates, even that is wrong. It is fine to learn from the mistake.
